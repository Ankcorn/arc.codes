Architect projects support text and binary static assets such as images, styles, and scripts. By default `@static` assets live in the `/public` folder locally and an S3 bucket once deployed.

## `@static` configuration options

- `folder public` configures the deployment folder (default is `public`)
- `fingerprint true` enables asset fingerprinting (default is `false`)
- `ignore` asset to ignore from deployment to S3

> Tip: `@static` assets are available at `/_static` which makes them **same-origin**

### `fingerprint`

Enable fingerprinting:

```arc
@static
fingerprint true
```

## `folder`

```arc
@static
folder dist
```

## `ignore`

Ignore zip and tar files in the `@static` folder:

```arc
@static
ignore
  zip
  tar
```

Ignore is greedy. For example if you ignore "foo", all filenames containing "foo" (or files with paths containing foo) will be ignored.

> By default, Architect ignores `.DS_Store`, `node_modules`, and `readme.md` files

### Referencing fingerprinted file paths at runtime

To get the correct path for generated files at runtime use `arc.static`.

```javascript
// src/http/get-index/index.js
let arc = require('@architect/functions')

exports.handler = async function http () {
  let html = `
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>This is fun!</title>
        <link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=${ arc.static('/index.css') }>
      </head>
      <body>Hello Æ›</body>
      <script src=${ arc.static('/index.js') }></script>
    </html>
  `
  return {
    type: 'text/html',
    body: html.trim()
  }
}
```

> Tip: `arc.http.proxy` will automatically redirect to fingerprinted file paths
