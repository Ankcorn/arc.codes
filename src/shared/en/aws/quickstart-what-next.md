# What next?

Now that you're familiar with the basics, it's time to build more complex apps. The guides below come with examples on [Architect GitHub](https://github.com/architect):

 - Add [lambdas](/guides/http) - these will be the basic routes of your app. Follow this to expand on the Hello World app we just made!

 - Use DynamoDB [data](/guides/data) to store and retrieve items from DynamoDB.

 - Use [sessions](/guides/sessions) - Architect comes with inbuilt, fast sessions thanks to DynamoDB.

 - Use [middleware](/guides/middleware) - middleware allows you to combine routing logic, and is useful for checking if a user is logged in, adding extra information to the request, and similar tasks tasks.

 - [Share code](/guides/sharing-common-code) between your lambdas

 - Add [background tasks](/guides/background-tasks) - useful for splitting up larger tasks into smaller ones
